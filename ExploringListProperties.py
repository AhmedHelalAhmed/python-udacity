# Investigating adding and appending to lists
# If you run the following four lines of codes, what are list1 and list2?

list1 = [1,2,3,4]
list2 = [1,2,3,4]

list1 = list1 + [5, 6] #add this elements to list
list2.append([5, 6]) #append this element to the list

# to check, you can print them out using the print statements below.

print "showing list1 and list2:"
print list1
print list2
